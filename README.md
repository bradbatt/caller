Hello. This is the code that I use to robocall all of my friends for porch hangs.

## Setup

- Get a Twilio account.
- Buy a phone number.
- Record voicemail and announcement MP3s.
- Edit everything in this to include your API keys and the correct links.
- Upload it, along with Twilioâ€™s PHP library, to your server.
- Visit index.php in your browser.

Use with caution.

This is entirely unsupported.

I release it into the public domain without qualification.

Enjoy.
